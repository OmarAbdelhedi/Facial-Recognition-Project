üîç Overview


This project implements a real-time facial recognition system using deep learning techniques. It leverages powerful models like MTCNN for face detection and InceptionResnetV1 for face recognition, providing accurate and efficient performance.


üöÄ Features


* Real-Time Face Detection: Utilizes MTCNN to detect faces in live video streams or images.
* Face Recognition: Employs InceptionResnetV1 to recognize and verify identities.
* Image and Video Support: Processes both static images and live video feeds.
* Embeddings Management: Stores and updates facial embeddings for known individuals.
